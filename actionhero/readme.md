# Actionhero project

This directory contains your Actionhero configuration.
The present files were generated by actionhero's project generator.

This directory and all of its contents will be copied to a working directory in your
user account.  The target location is a folder called `actionhero` inside of the location given by [app.getPath('userData')](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appgetpathname)

The `actionhero` working directory will be deleted & recreated anew each time the application launches.

Any files created in the course of running actionhero (logs, etc) will be placed in the working directory.
